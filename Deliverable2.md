## Completed User Stories
3)	As a vendor/user, I want a web app to create a calculated number representing the distributed shipping cost across the weight of the product that I buy so that I can apply it to the product that I sell in order to break even or turn a profit.
1)	As a user, I want to keep track of the total shipping cost of an order by using an import calculator so that I know how much coffee to buy to get the best pricing (shipping cost decreases per bag as number of bags goes up).
2)	As a vendor/user, I want the web app to calculate the specific shipping cost for importing a product into the country, separate from the rest of the shipping cost, so that I know exactly how much money I am spending out of pocket for the product.
